# Introduction

* Mathematical operations are a part of our daily lives. Everyday we will be involving with various types of calculations around us. Matrices is a mathematical entity where numbers are arranged in rows and columns. A lot of applications exist with matrices in real life.The major application lies in the software industry such as development of algorithms like path finder algorithms, image processing algorithms and many more.
*  In this project, some of the basic matrix operations are presented where a user can select the operation to be performed on the matrix. Then the matrices with their size are entered. Note that only square matrices are being considered for the project.

# Research

### Objective
This project focuses on matrix operations on square matrices. The operations performed on a pair of square matrices are, addition, subtraction, Division and multiplication. The operations performed on a single square matrix are, transpose, determinant and inverse. 

 ### Some of The features of the project

 * This program has dynamic memory allocation involved for allocating memory for the matrices, i.e 2 dimensional arrays. A structure is implemented for storing the input matrices. The user can select the opeation to be performed by pressing a number on the keyboard. The significance of each number, i.e the operation which it performs will be displayed on the screen during the execution of the program.

## Defining Our System

* The system on the whole is viewed as a blackbox which accepts input of a single number. Then the mapping of the number is done so as to perform the appropriate function. Then the user will be prompted to enter the matrix size. After that the user is prompted to enter the matrix elements. The input is stored in 2D arrays which are dynamically allocated and passed to the respective functions. Then the output is printed on the screen. This whole process is in a loop until the user presses a key which will exit the program.
